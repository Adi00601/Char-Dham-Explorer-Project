# Char-Dham-Explorer-Project

The **Char Dham Yatra** website is a best platform dedicated to the spiritual journey of the Char Dham pilgrimage in India, which includes four sacred sites: Rameswaram, Jagannath, Dwarka , and Badrinath. This project aims to provide users with in-depth information about each of these revered destinations, helping them plan their pilgrimage and enrich their travel experience.

The website is developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience. To enhance the visual appeal, I utilized **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for smooth animations, making the browsing experience more engaging. High-quality images have been carefully selected and optimized using online quality enhancement tools to ensure that visitors can appreciate the beauty of these sacred sites.

Data related to users is efficiently stored in **Google Sheets**, allowing for easy management and retrieval of information. This integration facilitates user interactions and enables seamless updates to the content displayed on the website.

Users can navigate through the site effortlessly, accessing detailed descriptions of each site, along with essential travel tips and must-visit attractions. The layout is designed to be user-friendly, providing an intuitive interface that guides visitors through the various sections of the website.

To run the project, simply download all the necessary files and open the `Landingpage.html` file using **VSCode** or any other integrated development environment (IDE). This setup ensures that you can experience the full functionality of the site, from smooth animations to rich content. 

In conclusion, the Char Dham Yatra website serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to explore these sacred destinations, offering insights that enhance their journey and deepen their understanding of the Char Dham pilgrimage.
